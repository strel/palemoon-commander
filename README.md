Pale Moon commander browser extension

This is a Pale Moon browser extension exposing a large number of advanced preferences to the browser UI.
Most preferences are mapped 1:1 to XUL overlay controls. This extension is a configurator: it will
permanently change existing browser preferences, and is ment as an aid for advanced configuration
of Pale Moon without having the need to dive into about:config.

This extension was originally licensed under a custom freeware license, but has been released to
the FOSS community under the MPL 2.0 on 2018-01-21 -- if you like it, fork away, and feel free to re-use
the code in compatible applications or extensions!
